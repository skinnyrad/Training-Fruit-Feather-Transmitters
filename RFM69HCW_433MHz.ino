//WHAT DO YOU WANT THIS TO DO?
// 1 - Transmit a single, set frequency
// 2 - Burst; specify frequency, length of burst, and how often to activate
// 3 - Spread spectrum; specify start and stop freq and hop interval
// 4 - Spread Spectrum Burst - This option allows you to turn your spread spectrum signal
//                            off and on like a burst transmitter.
// 5 - Spread Spectrum, Frequency Hoping, Burst - Allows the user to do everything entailed in
//                                           option 4, but the signal will randomly jump
//                                           between two specified frequencies.
