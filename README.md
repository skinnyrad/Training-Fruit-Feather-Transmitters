# Training Fruit Feather Transmitters
The Adafruit Feather is a fantastic microcontroller and when coupled with a variety of transmitters makes an impressive training aid. The code found in this repository covers four different models of Feather Transmitters:

Feather M0 WiFi ATSAMD21+ATWINC1500 https://www.adafruit.com/product/3010

Feather 32u4 RFM96 LoRa Radio - 433MHz https://www.adafruit.com/product/3079

Feather 32u4 RFM69HCW - 433MHz https://www.adafruit.com/product/3077

Feather 32u4 RFM96 LoRa Radio - 900MHz https://www.adafruit.com/product/3078

Feather 32u4 RFM69HCW - 900MHz https://www.adafruit.com/product/3076

These transmitters, minus the WiFi, can be given five different scenarios.
1. Single Continuous Transmission
2. Burst
3. Spread Spectrum
4. Spread Spectrum Burst
5. Spread Spectrum, Frequency Hoping, Burst
